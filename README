1. Vim Setup
===============================================================================
To use the static python checker in vim, we need to install flake8.
First install easy_install if it is not present.
    sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
Then install pip.
    sudo easy-install pip
Then install flake8 using pip:
    pip install flake9
